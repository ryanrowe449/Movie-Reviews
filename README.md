<h>Running the Program<h>
This can only run locally, so first download the '2' folder with everything in it. Once you have it on your local machine, open your terminal and cd into the '2' folder. From here, you just enter 'python app.py' or 'python3 app.py' and click the IP address to open in your browser.
